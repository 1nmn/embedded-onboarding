# Work for section 00

## 1. Make a GitHub account if you don't have one.

Use whatever email you prefer.

## 2. From the website, fork this repository to your account.

https://github.com/DallasFormulaRacing/embedded-onboarding

## 3. Install git.

There are mamy ways to do this. As long as it makes it to your `usr/bin`, it will work.

## 4. Using your terminal skills, navigate to a directory of your choosing.

Make sure this directory is safe, accessible, and ideally, built into your computer (not an external device). You will clone the forked repository into this repository in this next step so make sure this.

## 5. Clone the repository to your local.

Make sure its the right one; not the template.

## Done

You are done for this section.
