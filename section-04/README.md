# Operating Systems

An Operating System (OS) is a collection of software services, designed to close gaps between the
computer's hardware and software hierarchy. For example, if you use a high-level language to write
a program that prompts the user to enter some data using the keyboard, and you then plot this
data on the screen, the code generated by the compiler will include (among other things) calls to
OS routines that handle keyboard inputs and graphics outputs.

### Syscalls

These are done through `syscalls`, and are essentially the functionality that bridges high level i/o like inputs on a keyboard to outputting graphical outputs on your monitor. It is a request from a user level application to the operating system requesting some kind of service that can be approved or denied.

In layman's terms:

Your (user-space) program is running in a sandbox. In general, the only way for it to do something outside the sandbox is a system call (ignoring more advanced concepts).

Your program can do these things from inside the sandbox:

- Read and write memory that it created

- Call other functions that you wrote inside the program

- Simple math operations that uses the ALU and not an external accelerator

Your program cannot do these things without reaching outside the sandbox:

- Print text onto the screen

- Access files

- Make sounds

- Send/receive data over a network

System calls are the means by which your program reaches outside the sandbox

### The Kernel

The kernel is the core of any operating system and makes the absolute final decisions on hardware resource conflicts because it has complete control over everything in the system.

This is why you hear criticisms about [kernel-level anticheats](https://gist.github.com/stdNullPtr/2998eacb71ae925515360410af6f0a32) as some view this as an overkill breach of privacy and a massive, massive risk to their data.

Generally, the kernel is the second thing loaded into your computer (following the bootloader)
