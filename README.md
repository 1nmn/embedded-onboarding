# About

A collection of tutorials to help with the onboarding process for the embedded systems teams.

This onboarding tutorial as a whole serves to familiarize new and prospective memebers to the tools and skills the embedded teams use on a daily basis. Nearly all of the concepts in here are something a member should be able to understand to be a successful member on the team.
