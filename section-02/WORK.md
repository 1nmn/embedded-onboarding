# Work for section 02

Estimated completion time: 2 days.

Do all of your work in this directory (but not in this file) so that it can be easily reviewed by a senior member later.

You should constantly be referring back to the reading or other external sources. It is not expected of you to complete all the exercises in this unaided.

## Exercise 1

## Exercise 2

## Exercise 3

## Exercise 4: Write your own HAL

## Exercise 5: Capture the bug

Welcome to the last exercise! This is a capture-the-flag style mini-game which will require you to hunt for hidden symbols.

You are given a black-box-esque ELF binary named `vault`. Embedded within the executable and linkable regions is a secret message.

You must extract this secret message and decode it using `gdb`, `nm`, and `objdump`.
